PDF Studio Viewer is the best PDF viewer that I've found for Linux!
It's easy to install from their shell script, it's not too resource
hungry, and it's packed full of features!  It's also has a really
clean looking interface and is intuitive to use.  For creating PDF
files, check out their PDF Studio Pro edition - it's packed full of
features! qoppa.com/pdfstudio
