  Python script to automate the check of github hierarchical 
  directories.  The github directories are named with 
  dir-subdir-subsubdir format such that tracking the hierarchical 
  directories is easily trackable.

  The base directory being checked out to must have a manifest file with
  src/dest mapping or a ~/.manifest file must exist with the src/dest
  mapping.
